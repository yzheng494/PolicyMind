They are elementary for sustainable growth and increased resilience of the entyre economic system. Research and development (R & D) intensive companies not only create more jobs, they are more crisis-proof and more successful.   Against this background, the FTI location Austria has shown dynamic development in the past few years. The R&D expenditure in 2019 was 12.69 billion. Euros raised, which is approx. 3.18% of the gross domestic product (GDP). With the ratio of R & D expenditure to GDP, Austria has not only clearly exceeded the target of 3% set by the European Union (EU) by 2020, but also ranks fifth or worldwide. Positioned in second place across the EU. 22 public universities, 21 technical colleges, 5 central non-university research institutions, 3,489 research companies, a total of 5,084 research units, including many leading international companies, shape the Austrian research landscape.   Figure 1: Financing of research and experimental development carried out in Austria and research quota, 2009 - 2019   Source: Figure 1 - 1 Austrian Research and Technology Report 2020,   based on: Statistics Austria, global estimate from April 28, 2020, presentation: WPZ - Research; the category \\\\\"other\\\\\" includes the two categories \\\\\"other public funding\\\\\"   (incl. higher education sector) and \\\\\"private non-profit sector\\\\\" together.   The first Austrian overall strategy for research, technology and innovation from 2011 will expire at the end of 2020. The positive results include, among other things, the significant increase in the research quota from 2.67% in 2011 to 3.18% in 2019 as well as the proportional shift in investments to around 70% of financial resources towards private companies. The original goal of joining the \\\\\"Innovation Leader\\\\\" group in the European Innovation Scoreboard has not yet been achieved. In 2020, Austria ranked eighth and is therefore one of the \\\\\"Strong Innovators\\\\\".   Perspectives of the RTI Strategy 2030   The fragmentation of top research in Austria and the institutional fragmentation of scientific disciplines is a characteristic of an established research landscape. Increased cooperation is the answer. Closing the innovation chain is essential in order to improve the exploitation and overall impact of research. In the European research area, programmes are to be used more intensively, supplemented by the further international orientation of Austrian RTI activities. Research infrastructures - both for basic research and applied research - must meet top research standards.   Particular attention should also be paid to strengthening and expanding applied research as a bridging function between basic research and the needs of business and society, whereby the priorities must be coordinated with the relevant stakeholders. So z. B. the climate goals can only be achieved through a substantial contribution from research, technology and innovation. Research communication and an intensive dialogueue between science and the population can also be extremely helpful in overcoming other societal challenges. In addition, the research premium will be retained as a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) for the FTI location Austria.   What is the RTI strategy 2030 based on?   The RTI strategy 2030 is based on a clear commitment to efficiency and increased output in the system. The work on the RTI Strategy 2030 is largely based on the detailed analysis \\\\\"OECD Reviews of Innovation Policy: Austria 2018\\\\\". The Smart Specialisation concept of the European Commission was also used as a frame of reference for the development of the RTI Strategy 2030 In addition, cross-cutting issues (Sustainable Development Goals, digitization, strengthening equality in RTI, Responsible Science, Open Science and Open Innovation) as well as the first anchor points of the Excellence Initiative, the location strategy and the technology offensive formed the basis of this elabouration of the strategy.   RTI Strategy 2030: Involving Stakeholders   The present strategy reflects the interdepartmental governance of RTI policy. The FTI task force at a high administrative level consists of representatives from the Federal Chancellery, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research, the Federal Ministry for Digitization and Economy and the Federal Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and technology together. It continues the task of coordinating RTI policy at federal level and controls and accompanies the implementation of the RTI strategy. In developing this strategy, it was possible to draw on the expertise of a wide range of stakeholders.   RTI Strategy 2030: Pioneering Framework   According to the government programme, the RTI Strategy 2030 defines the main goals and fields of action of the RTI policy for the coming decade. Central cornerstonnees define the further development of Austria into a leading research, technology and innovation country. The RTI strategy guarantees a stable and long-term framework for this.   It is important to master the central challenges that have been analysed in a comprehensive process. To this end, in the course of the operationalisation of the RTI strategy, measures must primarily be defined in the RTI pacts, which are based on the goals set in the RTI strategy.   goals   The RTI strategy specifies the strategic direction for the next ten years in the form of overarching goals in order to (1) catch up with the top international field and strengthen Austria as a location for RTI, (2) focus on effectiveness and excellence and ( 3) to rely on knowledge, talents and skills.   With this, three essential and overarching goals are named, which indicate the clear and focused direction of the RTI strategy. Concrete target values characterise the orientation of the RTI strategy and make it easier to measure target achievement.   Goal 1: catch up with the top international field and strengthen Austria as a location for RTI   � Rank improvement in international indices (European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS): from Top 8 to Top 5; Digital Economy & Society Index (DESI): from Top 13 to Top 5; Global Innovation Index (GII): from Top 19 to Top 10) ;   � Recruit 5 - 10 new RTI - intensive lead companies and expand existing ones;   � Increase the number of constant R & D companies by 20%;   � Stronger positioning of Austria in the European value chains through participation in at least 3 further \\\\\"Important Projects of Common European Interest\\\\\" (IPCEIs - currently participation in 2);   � Use the opportunities of digitization for society, the economy, climate protection and administration for Austria and push ahead with the digital transformation.   Goal 2: Focus on effectiveness and excellence   � Gradual increase in R & D expenditure measured against GDP in order to catch up with the global top field (top 5) (currently 7th place in the OECD ranking);   � Expansion of the venture capital pool (also through the settlement and establishment of 5 corporate venture funds in Austria) in order to increase venture capital expenditure from 0.02% to 0.1% compared to GDP;   � 100% more economically successful academic spin-offs;   � Top 10 placement in European Research Council (ERC) grants (per inhabitant);   � Strengthen participation in Horizon Europe and consolidate top 3 placement in the success rate;   � Increase in the success rate of the corporate sector at Horizon Europe from 18.2% to at least 20%.   Goal 3: Rely on knowledge, talents and skills   � Increase in the proportion of mathematics, computer science, natural sciences and technology (MINT) graduates by 20%, increase in the proportion of women among graduates in technical subjects by 5%;   � Securing a top 3 place in the Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Talent Ranking (currently 4th place);   � Create incentives for entrepreneurial careers for scientists;   � Put 2 Austrian universities in the top 100 (according to the Times Higher Education World University Ranking, one university is currently in the top 200);   � Increase the proportion of academic and research personnel recruited from abroad, particularly at universities to 45%;   � 100% more Austrian MINT students who are studying or studying abroad through funding programmes.   Central fields of action   Eight fields of action are defined in order to achieve the goals in the next ten years. The fields of action pursue clear priorities and can be assigned to the goals. However, the fields of action interlock and work together. Therefore, individual fields of action also contribute to the achievement of several goals, even if they are mainly assigned to a specific goal in the following.   Areas of action Objective 1: catch up with the top international field and strengthen Austria as a location for RTI   The central fields of action for goal 1 (\\\\\"Open up to the top international field and strengthen the RTI location Austria\\\\\") are:   Expand research and technology infrastructure (FTIS) and ensure accessibility   � Integration of national RTIS in European and international large-scale research infrastructure projects;   � Evidence-based planning and long-term competitive funding models for participation in European and international research infrastructures;   � Creation of flexible access to RTIS for science and industry;   � Expansion of data infrastructures and data management taking into account the business secrets of companies.

Budgetary and European framework conditions   Research Financing Act and RTI Pacts   An important element for the implementation of the RTI strategy is the Research Financing Act (FoFinaG): According to the FoFinaG, the federal government adopts a pact for research, technology and innovation (RTI pact) every three years. This RTI pact is a central lever for the operationalisation of the RTI strategy. It guarantees growth-oriented financing and planning security. The RTI pact defines concrete measures for the implementation of the goals and fields of action set out in the RTI strategy. The FTI pact thus defines research and innovation priorities as well as budgets for a period of three years. It forms the framework for the performance or Financing agreements that are concluded with the central institutions named in the FoFinaG and thus essentially implement the RTI strategy or their goals and fields of action.   Central non-university research institutions in the FoFinaG are:   �   Austrian   Institute   of   Technology   GmbH   ( AIT )   �   Institute   of   Science   and   Technology   ( IST   Austria )   � Austrian Academy of Sciences (�AW)   � Silicon Austria Labs GmbH (SAL)   � Ludwig Boltzmann Society (LBG)   Central non-university research funding institutions in the FoFinaG are:   � Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft mbH (aws)   � Christian Doppler Research Society (CDG)   � Fund for the Promotion of Scientific Research (FWF)   � OeAD GmbH - Agency for Education and Internationalisation   � Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG)   RTI projects are by their nature medium to long-term. Here, the Research Financing Act creates through three - year performance and financing agreements and the resources assured with them, in addition to the necessary planning security, at the same time flexibility in implementation in order to be able to react to new priorities. These agreements are concluded on the basis of so-called \\\\\"RTI Pacts\\\\\" with the central research and research funding institutions and thus form the most important funding and control element of the federal government vis-�-vis the central institutions.   During the entyre term of the strategy, RTI issues of strategic relevance that have been identified can be taken up and corresponding new measures and priorities can be set, always under the premise that the goals and fields of action specified by the RTI strategy are neither thwarted nor neglected Maintain medium to long term projects.   Fund Future Austria   The National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development is to be developed into a \\\"Fund for the Future of Austria\\\". This is to complement the FTI Pact with a financing instrument for setting strategic priorities for important future fields and technologies in basic and applied research. The fund The future of Austria is to be provided with secure financing, the priorities being set annually by the federal government.   Use the possibilities of a common Europe   The principle of \\\\\"using the possibilities of a common Europe\\\\\" is a central instrument for implementing the RTI strategy Structural Funds (Smart Specialisation) and much more.   Horizon Europe will be relevant for almost the entyre duration of the RTI strategy. As the world's largest coherent research programme, Austrian research institutions and research sponsors participate in it and focus on the content   afterwards. Horizon Europe continues the path taken by the EU of strategically orienting the research framework programme and placing it even more at the service of major societal challenges.   Figure 2: The structure of Horizon Europe at a glance   Source: Figure 1 - 34 Austrian Research and Technology Report 2020, based on: FFG (2020).   Austrian RTI actors are given the best possible participation in the newly established EU missions and in the EU partnerships as well as in shaping them: Both a strategic approach at national level and an efficiently coordinated portfolio of funds serve this purpose.   The European Research Area (ERA) is to be strengthened in order to further increase the impact of European research and innovation. Attractive career opportunities for researchers as well as the quick and efficient transfer of research results into application are important goals of the ERA. Austria's active participation in the ERA is therefore being vigourously pursued.   Monitoring and evaluation system for the RTI strategy   Monitoring   The RTI strategy is trend-setting for the federal government, especially for the ministries entrusted with the agendas of research, technology and innovation. The achievement of the goals anchored in the RTI strategy is regularly monitored and evaluated. This ensures that undesirable developments are responded to quickly and appropriately.   Starting in 2021, the implemented measures will be continuously analysed with regard to the progress of the goals set out in the RTI Strategy 2030. The results are to be incorporated into the development of the three-year RTI pacts.   Evaluations   The strategic planning, implementation and processing of RTI policy can be optimised through scientifically excellent evaluations. Specifically, the control elements of state action can be improved in terms of their relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability and coherence. The achievement of the intended effects is chequeed in internal and external evaluations of selected programmes.   At the halfway point of the ten-year strategy, an external evaluation of the progress made up to that point in time based on the objectives or Indicators are carried out. After the RTI Strategy 2030 has expired, a corresponding external ex post evaluation is to take place.   The results of the evaluations and monitoring are used in order to learn from them how to make processes more efficient and effective, if necessary, to intervene and adjust the target dimensions.   Together with all Austrian research, technology and innovation policy decision-makers, the existing evaluation culture is constantly reflected in order to enable systemic learning.   \\\"\"'\n",

They are elementary for sustainable growth and increased resilience of the entyre economic system. Research and development (R & D) intensive companies not only create more jobs, they are more crisis-proof and more successful.   Against this background, the FTI location Austria has shown dynamic development in the past few years. The R&D expenditure in 2019 was 12.69 billion. Euros raised, which is approx. 3.18% of the gross domestic product (GDP). With the ratio of R & D expenditure to GDP, Austria has not only clearly exceeded the target of 3% set by the European Union (EU) by 2020, but also ranks fifth or worldwide. Positioned in second place across the EU. 22 public universities, 21 technical colleges, 5 central non-university research institutions, 3,489 research companies, a total of 5,084 research units, including many leading international companies, shape the Austrian research landscape.   Figure 1: Financing of research and experimental development carried out in Austria and research quota, 2009 - 2019   Source: Figure 1 - 1 Austrian Research and Technology Report 2020,   based on: Statistics Austria, global estimate from April 28, 2020, presentation: WPZ - Research; the category \\\\\\\\\"other\\\\\\\\\" includes the two categories \\\\\\\\\"other public funding\\\\\\\\\"   (incl. higher education sector) and \\\\\\\\\"private non-profit sector\\\\\\\\\" together.   The first Austrian overall strategy for research, technology and innovation from 2011 will expire at the end of 2020. The positive results include, among other things, the significant increase in the research quota from 2.67% in 2011 to 3.18% in 2019 as well as the proportional shift in investments to around 70% of financial resources towards private companies. The original goal of joining the \\\\\\\\\"Innovation Leader\\\\\\\\\" group in the European Innovation Scoreboard has not yet been achieved. In 2020, Austria ranked eighth and is therefore one of the \\\\\\\\\"Strong Innovators\\\\\\\\\".   Perspectives of the RTI Strategy 2030   The fragmentation of top research in Austria and the institutional fragmentation of scientific disciplines is a characteristic of an established research landscape. Increased cooperation is the answer. Closing the innovation chain is essential in order to improve the exploitation and overall impact of research. In the European research area, programmes are to be used more intensively, supplemented by the further international orientation of Austrian RTI activities. Research infrastructures - both for basic research and applied research - must meet top research standards.   Particular attention should also be paid to strengthening and expanding applied research as a bridging function between basic research and the needs of business and society, whereby the priorities must be coordinated with the relevant stakeholders. So z. B. the climate goals can only be achieved through a substantial contribution from research, technology and innovation. Research communication and an intensive dialogueue between science and the population can also be extremely helpful in overcoming other societal challenges. In addition, the research premium will be retained as a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) for the FTI location Austria.   What is the RTI strategy 2030 based on?   The RTI strategy 2030 is based on a clear commitment to efficiency and increased output in the system. The work on the RTI Strategy 2030 is largely based on the detailed analysis \\\\\\\\\"OECD Reviews of Innovation Policy: Austria 2018\\\\\\\\\". The Smart Specialisation concept of the European Commission was also used as a frame of reference for the development of the RTI Strategy 2030 In addition, cross-cutting issues (Sustainable Development Goals, digitization, strengthening equality in RTI, Responsible Science, Open Science and Open Innovation) as well as the first anchor points of the Excellence Initiative, the location strategy and the technology offensive formed the basis of this elabouration of the strategy.   RTI Strategy 2030: Involving Stakeholders   The present strategy reflects the interdepartmental governance of RTI policy. The FTI task force at a high administrative level consists of representatives from the Federal Chancellery, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research, the Federal Ministry for Digitization and Economy and the Federal Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and technology together. It continues the task of coordinating RTI policy at federal level and controls and accompanies the implementation of the RTI strategy. In developing this strategy, it was possible to draw on the expertise of a wide range of stakeholders.   RTI Strategy 2030: Pioneering Framework   According to the government programme, the RTI Strategy 2030 defines the main goals and fields of action of the RTI policy for the coming decade. Central cornerstonnees define the further development of Austria into a leading research, technology and innovation country. The RTI strategy guarantees a stable and long-term framework for this.   It is important to master the central challenges that have been analysed in a comprehensive process. To this end, in the course of the operationalisation of the RTI strategy, measures must primarily be defined in the RTI pacts, which are based on the goals set in the RTI strategy.   goals   The RTI strategy specifies the strategic direction for the next ten years in the form of overarching goals in order to (1) catch up with the top international field and strengthen Austria as a location for RTI, (2) focus on effectiveness and excellence and ( 3) to rely on knowledge, talents and skills.   With this, three essential and overarching goals are named, which indicate the clear and focused direction of the RTI strategy.

Here, the Research Financing Act creates through three - year performance and financing agreements and the resources assured with them, in addition to the necessary planning security, at the same time flexibility in implementation in order to be able to react to new priorities. These agreements are concluded on the basis of so-called \\\\\\\\\"RTI Pacts\\\\\\\\\" with the central research and research funding institutions and thus form the most important funding and control element of the federal government vis-�-vis the central institutions.   During the entyre term of the strategy, RTI issues of strategic relevance that have been identified can be taken up and corresponding new measures and priorities can be set, always under the premise that the goals and fields of action specified by the RTI strategy are neither thwarted nor neglected Maintain medium to long term projects.   Fund Future Austria   The National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development is to be developed into a \\\\\"Fund for the Future of Austria\\\\\". This is to complement the FTI Pact with a financing instrument for setting strategic priorities for important future fields and technologies in basic and applied research. The fund The future of Austria is to be provided with secure financing, the priorities being set annually by the federal government.   Use the possibilities of a common Europe   The principle of \\\\\\\\\"using the possibilities of a common Europe\\\\\\\\\" is a central instrument for implementing the RTI strategy Structural Funds (Smart Specialisation) and much more.   Horizon Europe will be relevant for almost the entyre duration of the RTI strategy. As the world\\'s largest coherent research programme, Austrian research institutions and research sponsors participate in it and focus on the content   afterwards. Horizon Europe continues the path taken by the EU of strategically orienting the research framework programme and placing it even more at the service of major societal challenges.   Figure 2: The structure of Horizon Europe at a glance   Source: Figure 1 - 34 Austrian Research and Technology Report 2020, based on: FFG (2020).   Austrian RTI actors are given the best possible participation in the newly established EU missions and in the EU partnerships as well as in shaping them: Both a strategic approach at national level and an efficiently coordinated portfolio of funds serve this purpose.   The European Research Area (ERA) is to be strengthened in order to further increase the impact of European research and innovation. Attractive career opportunities for researchers as well as the quick and efficient transfer of research results into application are important goals of the ERA. Austria\\'s active participation in the ERA is therefore being vigourously pursued.   Monitoring and evaluation system for the RTI strategy   Monitoring   The RTI strategy is trend-setting for the federal government, especially for the ministries entrusted with the agendas of research, technology and innovation. The achievement of the goals anchored in the RTI strategy is regularly monitored and evaluated. This ensures that undesirable developments are responded to quickly and appropriately.   Starting in 2021, the implemented measures will be continuously analysed with regard to the progress of the goals set out in the RTI Strategy 2030. The results are to be incorporated into the development of the three-year RTI pacts.   Evaluations   The strategic planning, implementation and processing of RTI policy can be optimised through scientifically excellent evaluations. Specifically, the control elements of state action can be improved in terms of their relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability and coherence. The achievement of the intended effects is chequeed in internal and external evaluations of selected programmes.   At the halfway point of the ten-year strategy, an external evaluation of the progress made up to that point in time based on the objectives or Indicators are carried out. After the RTI Strategy 2030 has expired, a corresponding external ex post evaluation is to take place.   The results of the evaluations and monitoring are used in order to learn from them how to make processes more efficient and effective, if necessary, to intervene and adjust the target dimensions.   Together with all Austrian research, technology and innovation policy decision-makers, the existing evaluation culture is constantly reflected in order to enable systemic learning.   \\\\\"\"'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='\"x\" \"1\" \"Austrian development and resilience plan 2020-2026   Vienna, 30.

It is one of the greatest challenges in   health, social and economic aspects.   The European Union reacted quickly to this challenge and with the   Development instrument \\\\\\\\\"Next Generation EU\\\\\\\\\" in the amount of 750 billion euros and that included   The development and resilience facility (ARF) included with a volume of 672.5 billion. Of which 312.5 billion. Euros in grants, a common funding instrument   created to cushion the effects of the pandemic on the economy and society in the coming years. The build - up and resilience facility is based on six   Pillars: transition to a green economy; digital change; smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs; social and territorial cohesion;   Health and resilience; Strategies for the next generation, children and youth, including education and skills.   The   Member States wishing to receive funding from the Facility, national structure - and   To draw up resilience plans (ARP) in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2021/241. These should contain an ambitious investment and reform agenda. The plans are closed   publish and submit to the European Commission. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may decide to provide financial resources for the implementation of the plan.   The Austrian development and resilience plan 2020-2026 follows the requirements of   Regulation and guidelines of the European Commission. The planned measures are based on the country-specific recommendations for Austria and the goals of the development and resilience facility and at the same time set sub-areas of the   Government programme. In accordance with EU requirements, all measures were taken after December 31. January 2020 entered into force. Austria submits measures in four priority areas - so-called components:   1) Sustainable construction   2) Digital structure   3) Knowledge-based structure   4) Fair construction   Since the allocation of part of the ARF funds is based on the economic development of all EU countries in the period 2019-2021, there are currently only provisional estimates of the extent of support for Austria. Based on the European Commission\\'s autumn 2020 forecast, Austria has grants of around 3.46 billion. Euros to. the   The final allocation will be made in June 2022, once the final Eurostat statistics on economic development 2019-2021 are available. The final allocation can thus   may be lower or higher, but will be of at least 3 billion. Out of euros. In order to take into account the possible range, the total volume of the ARP measures is 4.5 billion. Euro .   Until 31. August 2023 there is the possibility of receiving loans within the framework of the ARF   To avail. Austria does not intend to do this at the present time.   By submitting this plan to the European Commission, Austria applies for a pre-financing payment of 13% of the financial contribution in accordance with Article 13 (1) of Regulation 2021/241.   2 General objectives and coherence of the   Plans   2.1 Overview of the measures in the development and resilience plan   Take decisive action to deal with the economic crisis   The consequences of the corona pandemic presented the EU member states and thus also the national governments with major challenges. The pandemic hit the global economy harder than the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Austria was not spared either. The pandemic has resulted in over 10,000 deaths so far. as   COVID - due to the economic consequences, it reduced the nominal (real) gross domestic product by 22.0 (23.2) billion in 2020. Euros or 5.5% (6.6%) compared to 2019.   Just a few weeks after the outbreak of the pandemic and the entry into force of the corresponding health protection measures, the Austrian federal government took action   acted resolutely in order to mitigate as much as possible the economic and social effects of the crisis. Numerous immediate measures for COVID -   Crisis fighters have been established for different target groups   Securing the continued existence of companies, preventing an even stronger rise in unemployment and averting a crisis-related drift into poverty.   The largest rescue and stimulus package in the republic is one of the most extensive   Programmes in the European Union. Austria ranks among the international leaders in providing funds for emergency aid and bridging measures. About that   In addition, the Austrian federal government put together the first economic stimulus packages as early as June 2020, which in addition to relief measures for the citizens, for example by lowering the 1st Income - and   Wage taxe rate level from 25 to 20%, also incentives to invest in order to enable the course to be set for the future. The focus of these measures is to a large extent on promoting greening and digitization.   Invest and reform   The present Austrian development and resilience plan continues this logic and contains clear priorities on future-oriented investments and reforms. The funds from the Development and Resilience Facility will reinforce the stimulus package while at the same time helping to address economic, environmental and social weaknesses   To cope with Austria and to leverage future potential. As with national economic programmes, a particular focus is on climate protection and digitization. Austria invests in education, research, economy and sustainability and strengthens regions and communities in the process. It also reinforces reforms in the   four focal points (components) the respective investments.   Clear focus on new investments that have not yet been budgeted   Based on the European Commission\\'s autumn 2020 forecast, Austria has grants of just under 3.5 billion. Euros to. In order to take into account the possible range of the final grant volume, the total volume of the ARP measures is 4.5 billion. Euro .   Two thirds of the measures are new investments. You were in the previous one   Austrian budget planning not taken into account. This can be done both through entyrely   new investment channels take place, or through budget increases in existing programmes. A third of the measures of the ARP are in the federal budget 2021 or already included in the current Federal Financial Framework Act until 2024.   Focus on climate protection / greening and digitization   In line with the EU goals of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, promoting digital transformation and increasing employment and growth, Regulation (EU) 2021/241 requires that a minimum of 37% of investments by   Achievement of climate protection goals is to be devoted, and at least 20% to the digital transformation. The Austrian development and resilience plan goes well beyond this minimum share and contains a 46% share for climate protection purposes and a 41% share for digitization measures. In addition, the programme consistently takes into account the so-called \\\\\\\\\"Do no significant harm\\\\\\\\\" principle, which ensures   it should be ensured that none of the measures contradict the EU environmental objectives.   Component 1: Sustainable development   The corona crisis has led to a short-term decline in greenhouse gas emissions both at the EU level and in Austria.

Component 3: Knowledge-based structure   The current crisis has resulted in many people losing their jobs. Well-qualified specialists are essential for the Austrian economy   outstanding importance. One focus of the federal government lies in further measures for training and further education and thus the qualification of the   Employees. Due to the pandemic, children and adolescents are confronted with major challenges in teaching. All pupils should benefit from additional support offers and missed ones   Catch up on teaching content or deepen and consolidate knowledge and skills that have already been learned.   Research, technology and innovation are an important pillar of the knowledge-based structure. The RTI strategy gives the strategic in the form of overarching goals   Direction for the next ten years. Against this background, the   strategic development of research infrastructures is an important field of action. Another focus of the Austrian ARP is Quantum Austria, around the   Using quantum science successfully for innovative products and services and   to promote European technological sovereignty in this area, as well as the construction of the Centre for Precision Medicine. Another focus is participation in   cross-border innovations, in particular within the framework of the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI), a state aid instrument of the FTI - and   Industrial policy. The objectives of participating in the IPCEIs Microelectronics and Connectivity and Hydrogen are to ensure strategic autonneomy in the area   Semiconductor production and the strengthening of the business location in the field of future technologies.

In the area of health, the resilience of the Austrian system should, among other things. by expanding primary care, expanding community nursing and a   Further development of long-term care provision.   Art and culture have been badly hit by the pandemic and are also a strength of the country.
